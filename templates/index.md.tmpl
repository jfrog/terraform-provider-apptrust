# AppTrust Provider

{{ .Description | trimspace }}

## Authentication

The AppTrust provider supports several ways to authenticate:

### Access Token (Recommended)

The provider requires an Access Token to interact with the AppTrust API.

```terraform
provider "apptrust" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  access_token = "my-access-token"
}
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export JFROG_URL="https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
export JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-access-token"
```

### API Key (Deprecated)

API keys are deprecated but still supported for backward compatibility.

```terraform
provider "apptrust" {
  url     = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  api_key = "my-api-key"
}
```
