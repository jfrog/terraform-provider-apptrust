# JFrog AppTrust Provider

The [JFrog](https://jfrog.com/) AppTrust provider is used to interact with AppTrust features from the [JFrog Platform](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-rest-apis/jfrog-platform-rest-apis). The provider must be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Links to documentation for specific resources and data sources can be found in the table of contents to the left.

This provider requires Artifactory 7.125.0 or later, Xray 3.130.5 or later, and an Enterprise Plus license with AppTrust entitlements.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    apptrust = {
      source  = "jfrog/apptrust"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "apptrust" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  access_token = "my-access-token"
}

resource "apptrust_application" "example" {
  project_key      = "my-project"
  application_key  = "my-web-app"
  application_name = "My Web Application"
  description      = "Application managed by Terraform"
  maturity_level   = "production"
  criticality      = "high"
}
```

## Authentication

The AppTrust provider supports several ways to authenticate:

### Access Token (Recommended)

The provider requires an Access Token to interact with the AppTrust API.

```terraform
provider "apptrust" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  access_token = "my-access-token"
}
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export JFROG_URL="https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
export JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-access-token"
```

### API Key (Deprecated)

API keys are deprecated but still supported for backward compatibility.

```terraform
provider "apptrust" {
  url     = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  api_key = "my-api-key"
}
```

## Requirements

- Terraform 1.0 or later (or OpenTofu 1.0+)

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) This is a access token that can be given to you by your admin under `User Management -> Access Tokens`. If not set, the 'api_key' attribute value will be used.
- `api_key` (String, Sensitive, Deprecated) API key. If `access_token` attribute, `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is set, the provider will ignore this attribute.
- `url` (String) Artifactory URL.

## AppTrust API Endpoints

This provider uses the JFrog AppTrust API (e.g. `/artifactory/apptrust/api/v1` or `/apptrust/api/v1`) to manage applications, versions, promotions, releases, and package bindings.

### Application and Version Management

- **Applications** — Create, update, and delete applications with project key, name, description, owner, criticality, maturity, and labels. Use the `apptrust_application` resource and `apptrust_application` / `apptrust_applications` data sources.
- **Application versions** — Create and manage versions with optional source artifacts, builds, or other application versions. Use `apptrust_application_version` and the `apptrust_application_versions` / `apptrust_application_version_status` data sources.
- **Promotions** — Promote a version to a lifecycle stage (e.g. QA, PROD). Use `apptrust_application_version_promotion` and `apptrust_application_version_promotions`.
- **Release and rollback** — Release a version to PROD or roll back the latest promotion. Use `apptrust_application_version_release` and `apptrust_application_version_rollback`.
- **Package bindings** — Bind package versions to an application; list bound packages or their versions. Use `apptrust_bound_package`, `apptrust_application_package_bindings`, and `apptrust_bound_package_versions`.
