# AppTrust Provider



## Authentication

The AppTrust provider supports several ways to authenticate:

### Access Token (Recommended)

The provider requires an Access Token to interact with the AppTrust API.

```terraform
provider "apptrust" {
  url          = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  access_token = "my-access-token"
}
```

You can also use environment variables:

```bash
export JFROG_URL="https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
export JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN="my-access-token"
```

### API Key (Deprecated)

API keys are deprecated but still supported for backward compatibility.

```terraform
provider "apptrust" {
  url     = "https://myinstance.jfrog.io/artifactory"
  api_key = "my-api-key"
}
```

## Requirements

- Artifactory 7.125.0 or later
- Xray 3.130.5 or later

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) This is a access token that can be given to you by your admin under `User Management -> Access Tokens`. If not set, the 'api_key' attribute value will be used.
- `api_key` (String, Sensitive, Deprecated) API key. If `access_token` attribute, `JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `ARTIFACTORY_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is set, the provider will ignore this attribute.
- `url` (String) Artifactory URL.

## AppTrust API Endpoints

This provider uses the JFrog Artifactory REST API to interact with AppTrust features. Specific endpoints will be documented as resources and data sources are implemented.
