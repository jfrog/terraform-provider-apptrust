  API Notes
  The API endpoint GET /v1/applications supports filtering by project_key, name, criticality, maturity, label, and owner (each filter can be specified multiple times where applicable).The maturity query parameter is used for filtering (not maturity_level); the response uses maturity_level in application objects.Pagination is supported via limit (default 100) and offset (default 0).Ordering is via order_by (name or created; default created) and order_asc (default false).

# apptrust_applications (Data Source)

Returns a list of AppTrust applications, including the latest version and the total number of versions. Supports filtering, pagination, and sorting.

## API Notes

- The API endpoint `GET /v1/applications` supports filtering by project_key, name, criticality, maturity, label, and owner (each filter can be specified multiple times where applicable).
- The `maturity` query parameter is used for filtering (not `maturity_level`); the response uses `maturity_level` in application objects.
- Pagination is supported via `limit` (default 100) and `offset` (default 0).
- Ordering is via `order_by` (name or created; default created) and `order_asc` (default false).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# List applications with filters (GET /v1/applications).
# Use maturity (not maturity_level) for the filter. Labels in "key:value" format.
data "apptrust_applications" "filtered" {
  project_key = "my-project"
  maturity    = "production"
  criticality = "high"

  labels = [
    "environment:production",
    "region:us-east"
  ]

  owners = [
    "admin",
    "devops-team"
  ]

  order_by  = "name"   # or "created" (API default)
  order_asc = true
  limit     = 10
  offset    = 0
}

output "filtered_applications" {
  value = {
    total        = data.apptrust_applications.filtered.total
    applications = data.apptrust_applications.filtered.applications
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `criticality` (String) Filters results by application criticality. Allowed values: unspecified, low, medium, high, critical
- `labels` (List of String) Filters by application labels in the format 'key:value'. Can be specified multiple times (once per label). Example: ["environment:production", "region:us-east"]
- `limit` (Number) Sets the maximum number of applications to return at one time. Used for pagination. API default is 100.
- `maturity` (String) Filters results by application maturity. Allowed values: unspecified, experimental, production, end_of_life
- `name` (String) Filters results by the application name.
- `offset` (Number) Sets the number of records to skip before returning the query response. Used for pagination. API default is 0.
- `order_asc` (Boolean) Defines whether to list the applications in ascending (true) or descending (false) order. API default is false.
- `order_by` (String) Defines whether to order the applications by name or created. Allowed values: name, created. API default is 'created'.
- `owners` (List of String) Filters results by application owners (user or group). This filter can be used multiple times.
- `project_key` (String) The key of the project associated with the application. If not specified, applications from all projects will be returned.

### Read-Only

- `applications` (Attributes List) List of applications. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--applications))
- `total` (Number) Total number of applications matching the filter criteria.
