  application_name = "My Web Application"
  project_key      = "my-project"
  description      = "A sample web application managed by Terraform"
  maturity_level   = "production"
  criticality      = "high"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    region      = "us-east"
    team        = "platform"
  }

  user_owners = [
    "admin",

## Schema

### Required

- `application_key` (String) The application key. Must be 2-64 lowercase alphanumeric characters, beginning with a letter (hyphens are supported). The key must be unique and immutable. Cannot be changed after creation. Changing this field will force replacement of the resource.

- `project_key` (String) The key of the project associated with the application. Cannot be changed after creation. Changing this field will force replacement of the resource.

### Optional

- `criticality` (String) A classification of how critical the application is for your business. Allowed values: unspecified, low, medium, high, critical. Defaults to 'unspecified' if not set.
- `description` (String) A free-text description of the application.
- `group_owners` (List of String) List of user groups defined in the project who own the application. Each group must be at least 1 character in length.

- `maturity_level` (String) The maturity level of the application. Allowed values: unspecified, experimental, production, end_of_life. Defaults to 'unspecified' if not set.
- `user_owners` (List of String) List of users defined in the project who own the application. Each user must be at least 1 character in length.
